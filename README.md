# Nucleus-Logic
An Agentic RAG framework for automated financial auditing and logic verification using Azure OpenAI.
# Nucleus Logic
> **Pioneering "Digital Forensic" for Financial Intelligence.**

## 🌐 Project Overview
Nucleus Logic is an advanced **Agentic RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** platform designed to eliminate AI hallucinations in financial auditing. Unlike traditional summary tools, we focus on **"Evidence Anchoring"**—mapping every AI-generated conclusion to physical coordinates (x, y) within original financial filings.

## 🚀 Key Features
- **Evidence Anchoring System**: Direct traceability from quantitative analysis to PDF source coordinates.
- **Nucleus-Soul Audit Model**: A six-dimensional decision engine analyzing corporate narrative (Story) vs. actual power structure (Soul).
- **Logic Wind Tunnel**: Stress-testing future growth narratives against historical "Realities."
- **Distributed Orchestration**: Built with n8n, FastAPI, and Azure OpenAI Service for enterprise-grade scalability.

## 🛠 Technology Stack
- **AI/LLM**: Azure OpenAI (GPT-4o / GPT-4 Turbo)
- **Orchestration**: n8n, Python (FastAPI), RGA，KG
- **Vector DB**: Azure AI Search
- **Infrastructure**: Docker, Microsoft Azure

## 📅 Roadmap
- [x] V1.1 Core Logic Logic Blueprint completed.
- [x] Distributed data ingestion pipeline (PDF-to-Coordinates) finalized.
- [ ] Integration with Azure OpenAI Service (Founders Hub Application Pending).
- [ ] Alpha release for selected VC/Institutional investors.
